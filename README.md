# Savings_planner_tool
## A web app to plan your savings and investments in a realistic way.

Hello world,

Since the apparition of low-cost brokers (Robinhood, Nordnet, ...) more and more people are investing their savings with the hope of growing their wealth. Although many forms of investment exist (savings accounts, real estate, government bills, corporate bond, commodities, ...), the lure of a quick buck pushes most non-professional investors to buy and sell only common stocks, often over very short periods of time. What they see are the few lucky (and skilled?) investors who become wealthy enough to write books and have successful investing YouTube channels. However, for each of these _investing gurus_ how many others lose part or all of their hard-earned money?

Losing one's savings can have devastating consequences for one's mental well-being and financial future. In most cases, it is not a sign of lacking intelligence but rather of lacking exposure to diverse forms of financial education. If all you hear is tales of people buying 1000$ worth of stocks and becoming millionaires the next week, how can it not seem easy?

This **Savings planner tool** was made with the opposite mindset. It assumes that, like me, you hate risk, you have no particular desire to reach obscene levels of wealth and your only concern is financial safety. That being said, this tool is for informational purposes only and does not constitue financial advice in any shape or form. Should you choose to invest your money, you will do so at your own peril; any kind of investment has risks that come with it and it will never be possible to guarantee complete financial safety. I am not a financial advisor and you should always do your own research on an investment before spending your money. I strongly recommend that you consult a professional investment advisor before making any investment decisions!
